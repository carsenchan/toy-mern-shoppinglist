# MERN - Shopping List
- MongoDB - mLab
- Express as server
- React as frontend UI which my favourite
- Nodejs, also my current hot skill

### Skill Get:
 - (package) concurrently - multiple run npm scripts
 - (package) reactstrap - convert html tag into Component. However, bootstrap, i like more, since reactstrp its pre-defined css is not easy to modified, why not bootstrap?
 - (Application Deploy Platform) Heroku - first time use it. Seems good to my toy deployment~~~ :D
 - (Redux) prefer use redux-saga 

### Installation
For Express API Installaton...
```sh
$ npm install
```
For Client Installation...
```sh
$ npm run client-install
```
For Debug locally... (Feel free to use Redux-DevTools Extension)
```sh
$ npm run client-install
```
